# terms4FAIRskills development directory

Building a terminology for the skills necessary to make data FAIR and to keep it FAIR.

## Directory Contents

This directory contains the following:
* scripts/ : a directory containing convenience scripts for manipulating the ontology using SPARQL queries


Our new build procedure makes this directory redundant, and we will move the content of scripts/ to the src/scripts/ directory once the new procedure is running smoothly.
