De-anonymization	Information security	De-anonymization is a reverse engineering process in which de-identified data are cross-referenced with other data sources to re-identify the personally identifiable information. This could occur if a de-identification process had not been not successfully performed, or had not been undertaken in the first place.	Allyson Lister|Peter McQuilton
De-identification	Information security	1. The act of minimally perturbing individual-level data to decrease the probability of discovering an individualís identity. It involves masking direct identifiers (e.g., name, phone number, address) as well as transforming indirect identifiers that could be used alone or in combination to-identify an individual (e.g., birth dates, geographic details, dates of key events). If done correctly, de-identification is a defensible, repeatable, and auditable process that consistently provides assurance, based on generally accepted and repeatable statistical methodologies, that there is a very small risk of re-identification of any data that are released. 2. The use of one or more techniques designed to make it impossible — or at least more difficult — to identify a particular individual from stored data related to them. The purpose of data anonymization is to protect the privacy of the individual and to make it legal for governments and businesses to share their data without obtaining permission. Such data have proven to be very valuable for researchers, particularly in health care. Data anonymization methods include removing personally identifiable information (e.g., names, addresses, social insurance numbers, Medicare numbers, etc.), or using obfuscation methods such as encryption, hashing, generalization, pseudonymization, and perturbation.	Allyson Lister|Peter McQuilton	Anonymization

Golden record	Data stewardship technical concept	1. A single, well-defined version of all the data entities in an organizational ecosystem. In this context, a golden record is sometimes called the single version of the truth, where truth is understood to mean the reference to which data users can turn when they want to ensure that they have the correct version of a piece of information. The golden record encompasses all the data in every system of record within a particular organization. A system of record is an information storage and retrieval system that serves as the authoritative source for a particular data element in a system containing multiple sources of the same element. To ensure data integrity, a single system of record must always exist for each and every data element. A well-maintained, current golden record should be a fundamental element of the Master Data Management policy for every enterprise. 2. The word “golden” is sometimes used in information technology to express the importance of some type of source. In the context of virtualization, for example, a golden image is a template for a virtual machine, virtual desktop, servers, or hard disk drive.	Allyson Lister|Peter McQuilton

OAI-PMH is a set of six verbs or services that are invoked within HTTP.	Peter McQuilton
Open access publishing	Publish data		Allyson Lister|Celia van Gelder|Mateusz Kuzak|Yan Wang						AL 22.3.22: refactored 'open access publishing and self-archiving' to be two separate concepts ('open access publishing', and 'self-archiving') according to T4FS best practices. Self-archiving did not have to be created because we already had self-archive, which was then moved to the Archiving hierarchy. 'publish open access' was also removed in favour of this term as they were too similar to have without the potential for confusion by users.
Open data	Data stewardship technical concept	Strutured data that are accessible, machine-readable, usable, intelligible, and freely shared. Open data can be freely used, re-used, built on, and redistributed by anyone - subject only, at most, to the requirement to attribute and sharealike.	Allyson Lister|Peter McQuilton

(Meta)data are assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier'|Persistent identifier	A type of record (and organization) that stores an instance of an executable/understandable PID. The content of a PID record distinguishes a registered digital or data object from other DOs. A PID record is a type of record that includes property information that characterizes the digital object it is identifying. Important parts of a PID record are location and checksum. However there is a large variation in usage. In some data models the PID is simply used as a unique label with an empty record. A PID record has a lifecycle including creation, publication, Curation and the destruction.	Allyson Lister|Peter McQuilton

Allyson Lister|Peter McQuilton
Persistent uniform resource locator	'contributes to the implementation of' some 'F1. (Meta)data are assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier'|Persistent identifier	This is a URL. However, instead of pointing directly to the location of an Internet resource, a PURL points to an intermediate resolution service. The PURL resolution service associates the PURL with the actual URL and returns that URL to the client.	Allyson Lister|Peter McQuilton
Personal information privacy	Data stewardship technical concept	The World Wide Web Consortium’s Platform for Personal Privacy Project (P3P) offers specific recommendations for practices that will let users define and share personal information with Web sites that they agree to share it with. The P3P incorporates a number of industry proposals, including the Open Profiling Standard (OPS). Using software that adheres to the P3P recommendations, users will be able to create a personal profile, all or parts of which can be made accessible to a Web site as the user directs. A tool that will help a user decide whether to trust a given Website with personal information is a Statement of Privacy Policy that a Web site can post.	Allyson Lister|Peter McQuilton
Personally identifiable information	Personal information privacy	1. Data which relate to a living individual who can be identified (a) from those data, or (b) from those data and other information which is in the possession of, or is likely to come into the possession of, the data controller, and includes any expression of opinion about the individual and any indication of the intentions of the data controller or any other person in respect of the individual. 2. Any data that could potentially identify a specific individual. Any information that can be used to distinguish one person from another and can be used for de-anonymizing anonymous data can be considered personally identifiable data. 3. Data are identifiable if the information contains the name of an individual, or other identifying items such as birth date, address or geocoding. Data will be identifiable if the information contains a unique personal identifier and the holder of the information also has the master list linking the identifiers to individuals. Data may also be identifiable because of the number of different pieces of information known about a particular individual. It may also be possible to ascertain the identity of individuals from aggregated data where there are very few individuals in a particular category. Identifiability is dependent on the amount of information held and also on the skills and technology of the holder.	Allyson Lister|Peter McQuilton
Pipe separated values	'contributes to the implementation of' some 'I1. (Meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation'|Data stewardship technical concept	A file that contains the values in a table as a series of ASCII text lines organized so that each column value is separated by a pipe.

Record	Data stewardship technical concept	1. A collection of data items arranged for processing by a program. Multiple records are contained in a file or dataset. Typically, records can be of fixed-length or be of variable length with the length information contained within the record. 2. A record (sometimes called a row) is a group of fields (sometimes called columns) within a table that are relevant to a specific entity.	Allyson Lister|Peter McQuilton
Record provenance information	'contributes to the implementation of' some 'F2. Data are described with rich metadata'|Metadata	Information for a data object that includes: * the person who deposited the data object in the repository, * the source of the data object, * the date when the object was deposited, and * authenticity information needed to link the data object to its original source.	Allyson Lister|Peter McQuilton
Record standardization	Data stewardship technical concept	A process in which files are first parsed (assigned to appropriate fields in a record) and then translated to a common format. For example, if an original record had the client’s name and address as “Bob Jones, VP Acme. Co., 15 S. Main St, Brooklyn” the standardized record might read “Bob Jones, Vice President, Acme Corporation, 15 South Main Street, Brooklyn, New York”. Data often lack consistency simply because there are a many of ways of saying the same thing. Standardizing the record ensures that when a query is run for a particular field, accurate results will be returned.	Allyson Lister|Peter McQuilton

For example, national standards bodies in Europe are also members of the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) as well as members of ISO. The use of such standards may be voluntary, or they may be referenced in regulation (therefore mandatory).	Allyson Lister|Peter McQuilton						AL 9.3.22: Removed reference to CASRAI (https://casrai.org/term/regional-standard/), as the definition was unsuitable.
Registered data	Data stewardship technical concept	Data that have gone through a registration process and have been assigned an identifier metadata to aid in their search and retrieval.	Allyson Lister|Peter McQuilton
Registry	Data stewardship technical concept	A database containing information about trusted repositories that are provided by the repository managers and are useful for human and machine users. It is a registry information system on which a register is maintained. These registries do not contain information about all metadata descriptions of digital objects, nor do they offer a list of PIDs of all stored digital objects. They do offer information based on standardized types on how to retrieve such information (e.g., the port under which OAI-PMH can be accessed to offer metadata). It is a set of files containing identifiers assigned to items with descriptions of the associated items. It is assignment of a permanent, unique and unambiguous identifier to an item.	Allyson Lister|Peter McQuilton
Relational database	Data stewardship technical concept	A collection of data items organized as a set of formally-described tables from which data can be accessed or reassembled in many different ways without having to reorganize the database tables. The standard user and application program interface to a relational database is the structured query language (SQL).	Allyson Lister|Peter McQuilton

Remote access	Data stewardship technical concept	The ability to get access to a computer or a network from a remote distance. Access may be through an Internet service provider (ISP) or through a dedicated line between a computer or a remote local area network and the central or main corporate local area network. A dedicated line is more expensive and less flexible but offers faster data rates.	Allyson Lister|Peter McQuilton
Remote data access	Data stewardship technical concept	The ability to access and download data from a repository.	Allyson Lister|Peter McQuilton
Repository	Data stewardship technical concept	Repositories preserve, manage, and provide access to many types of digital materials in a variety of formats.	Allyson Lister|Peter McQuilton

Research data may be experimental data, observational data, operational data, third party data, public sector data, monitoring data, processed data, or repurposed data.	Allyson Lister|Peter McQuilton
Research data format	Data stewardship technical concept	Research data format is a generic term encompassing the concept of a standardised format for research data.	Allyson Lister|Peter McQuilton						AL 9.3.2022: The original CASRAI definition is unsuitable (https://casrai.org/term/research-data-format), therefore I have changed the definition to something more generic.
Research data management	Data management	Data Management refers to the storage, access and preservation of data produced from a given investigation. Data management practices cover the entire lifecycle of the data, from planning the investigation to conducting it, and from backing up data as it is created and used to long term preservation of data deliverables after the research investigation has concluded. Specific activities and issues that fall within the category of data management include: File naming (the proper way to name computer files); data quality control and quality assurance; data access; data documentation (including levels of uncertainty); metadata creation and controlled vocabularies; data storage; data archiving and preservation; data sharing and reuse; data integrity; data security; data privacy; data rights; notebook protocols (lab or field).	Allyson Lister|Peter McQuilton
Research data management infrastructure	Data stewardship technical concept	The configuration of staff, services and tools assembled to support data management across the research lifecycle and more specifically to provide comprehensive coverage of the stages making up the data lifecycle. It can be organized locally and/or globally to support research data activities across the research lifecycle.	Allyson Lister|Peter McQuilton
Research data publication workflow	Data stewardship activity	Activities and processes in a digital environment that lead to the publication of research data, associated metadata and accompanying documentation and software code on the Web. In contrast to interim or final published products, workflows are the means to curate, document, and review, and thus ensure and enhance the value of the published product. Workflows can involve both humans and machines and often humans are supported by technology as they perform steps in the workflow. Similar workflows may vary in the details depending on the research discipline, data publishing product and/or the host institution of the workflow (e.g., individual publisher/journal, institutional repository, discipline-specific repository).	Allyson Lister|Peter McQuilton

Schema	Data stewardship technical concept	1. The organization or structure for a database. The activity of data modeling leads to a schema. (The plural form is schemata.) The term is used in discussing both relational databases and object-oriented databases. The term sometimes seems to refer to a visualization of a structure and sometimes to a formal text-oriented description. Two common types of database schemata are the star schema and the snowflake schema. 2. A formal expression of an inference rule for artificial intelligence (AI) computing. The expression is a generalized axiom in which specific values or cases are substituted for each symbol in the axiom to derive a specific inference.	Allyson Lister|Peter McQuilton

Semantic interoperability	'contributes to the implementation of' some 'I2. (Meta)data use vocabularies that follow FAIR principles'|Data stewardship technical concept	The ability of computer systems to transmit data with unambiguous, shared meaning. Semantic interoperability is a requirement to enable machine computable logic, inferencing, knowledge discovery, and data federation between information systems. Semantic interoperability is achieved when the information transferred has, in its communicated form, all of the meaning required for the receiving system to interpret it correctly, even when the algorithms used by the receiving system are unknown to the sending system. Syntactic interoperability is a prerequisite to semantic interoperability.	Allyson Lister|Peter McQuilton
Semi-structured data	Data stewardship technical concept	Data that have not been organized into a specialized repository, such as a database, but that nevertheless have associated information, such as metadata, that makes them more amenable to processing than raw data. Semi-structured data lie somewhere between structured and unstructured data. They are not organized in a complex manner that makes sophisticated access and analysis possible. However, they may have information associated with them, such as metadata tagging that allows elements contained to be addressed. Example: A Word document is generally considered to be unstructured data. However, metadata tags could be added in the form of keywords and other metadata that represent the document content and make it easier for that document to be found when people search for those terms — the data are now semi-structured. Nevertheless, the document still lacks the complex organization of a database, so falls short of being fully structured data.	Allyson Lister|Peter McQuilton
Service level management	'has/wants competency in' some 'Data stewardship activity'|'has/wants competency in' some 'Skills for resource management'|Resource management	It can be considered as a negotiated agreement between the customer and vendor which are acceptable to both parties with respect to costs and expectations in order to support the business process.

Trusted Digital Repository	Data stewardship technical concept	An infrastructure component that provides reliable, long-term access to managed digital resources. It stores, manages, and curates digital objects and returns their bit streams when a request is issued. Trusted repositories undergo regular assessments according to a set of rules such as defined by Data Seal of Approval (DSA) or TRAC (ISO 16363). It is well understood that such an assessment has the potential of increasing trust from its depositors and users, but it will not be the only criterion for users. Repositories can be at different stages of assessments. However, it is evident that certain quality criteria need to be met to distinguish trusted repositories from all types of other entities that store data such as notebooks or lab servers.
