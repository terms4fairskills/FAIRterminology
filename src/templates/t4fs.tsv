Data cleaning is a continuous process that requires corrective actions throughout the data lifecycle. Data cleaning involves identifying, replacing, modifying or deleting incomplete, incorrect, inaccurate, inconsistent, irrelevant, and improperly formatted data.

obo:T4FS_0000132	data curation	curation	Managed process throughout the data lifecycle, by which data/data collections are cleansed, documented, standardised, formatted and inter-related. This includes versioning data, or forming a new collection from several data sources, annotating with metadata, adding codes to raw data (e.g., classifying a galaxy image with a galaxy type such as “spiral”). Higher levels of curation involve maintaining links with annotation and with other published materials. Thus a dataset may include a citation link to publication whose analysis was based on the data. The goal of curation is to manage and promote the use of data from its point of creation to ensure it is fit for contemporary purpose and available for discovery and re-use. For dynamic datasets this may mean continuous enrichment or updating to keep it fit for purpose. Special forms of curation may be available in data repositories. The data curation process itself must be documented as part of curation. Thus curation and provenance are highly related.

There are several different approaches to data modelling, including: Conceptual Data Modelling (identifies the highest-level relationships between different entities); Enterprise Data Modelling (similar to conceptual data modelling, but addresses the unique requirements of a specific organisation); Logical Data Modelling (illustrates the specific entities, attributes and relationships involved in a business function.

It includes the development of such things as mission statements, statements of organizational objectives and values, logic models, organizational performance metrics, risk management frameworks, policies and guidelines for financial and operational matters, stakeholder relations, etc.	Definition from now-deprecated CASRAI Glossary term: governance	https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2687-1982|https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5214-4466

obo:T4FS_0000224	normalization	data stewardship technical concept	Organising data into tables so that the results of using the database are always unambiguous and as intended. Normalisation is typically a refinement process after the initial exercise of identifying the data objects that should be in the database, identifying their relationships, and defining the tables required and the columns within each table. First normal form (1NF) is the “basic” level of normalisation: Data and information are contained in two-dimensional tables with rows and columns. Each column corresponds to a sub-object or an attribute of the object represented by the entire table. Each row represents a unique instance of that sub-object or attribute and must be different in some way from any other row (that is, no duplicate rows are possible). All entries in any column must be of the same kind. For example, in the column labelled “Date,” only dates are permitted. In Second normal form (2NF), the tables are in first normal form and, in addition, each column in a table that is not a determiner of the contents of another column must itself be a function of the other columns in the table. At the second normal form, modifications are still possible because a change to one row in a table may affect data that refers to this information from another table. In Third normal form (3NF), the tables are in second normal form and, in addition, there is no transitive functional dependency. For example, if A is functionally dependent on B, and B is functionally dependent on C, then C is transitively dependent on A via B. In Domain/key normal form (DKNF), a key uniquely identifies each row in a table. A domain is the set of permissible values for an attribute. By enforcing key and domain restrictions, the database is assured of being freed from modification anomalies. DKNF is the normalisation level that most designers aim to achieve.

(meta)data use vocabularies that follow fair principles'|data stewardship technical concept	Ability of computer systems to transmit data with unambiguous, shared meaning. Semantic interoperability is a requirement to enable machine computable logic, inferencing, knowledge discovery, and data federation between information systems. Semantic interoperability is achieved when the information transferred has, in its communicated form, all of the meaning required for the receiving system to interpret it correctly, even when the algorithms used by the receiving system are unknown to the sending system. Syntactic interoperability is a prerequisite to semantic interoperability. Semantic interoperability ensures that the precise format and meaning of exchanged data and information is preserved and understood throughout exchanges between parties; in other words, what is sent is what is understood.
