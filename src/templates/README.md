# ROBOT templates

Editors of this ontology should use the templates available for comment via our (Google spreadsheet)[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pu9o8oiP1hwnyQk1tv_8cdoe07GngINRD5pGz04m4Zo/edit?usp=sharing]. The default permissions for this spreadsheet is Comment only. Please ask if you would like permission to modify it. The "traditional" editable document for the ODK build procedure is [src/ontology/t4fs-edit.owl](src/ontology/t4fs-edit.owl), however -- other than the top-level ontology annotations -- its contents are added via templates.

By using Google spreadsheets, we open up our ontology for comment and editing to our community who are experts in the domain but who may not be ontologists.
