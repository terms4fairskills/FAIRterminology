It can also be used to provide metrics to assess data quality and help determine whether or not metadata accurately describes the source data. Profiling tools evaluate the actual content, structure and quality of the data by exploring relationships that exist between value collections both within and across datasets. For example, by examining the frequency distribution of different values for each column in a table, an analyst can gain insight into the type and use of each column. Cross-column analysis can be used to expose embedded value dependencies and inter-table analysis allows the analyst to discover overlapping value sets that represent foreign key relationships between entities."

Semi-structured data lie somewhere between structured and unstructured data. They are not organized in a complex manner that makes sophisticated access and analysis possible. However, they may have information associated with them, such as metadata tagging that allows elements contained to be addressed. Example: A Word document is generally considered to be unstructured data. However, metadata tags could be added in the form of keywords and other metadata that represent the document content and make it easier for that document to be found when people search for those terms — the data are now semi-structured. Nevertheless, the document still lacks the complex organization of a database, so falls short of being fully structured data."

Data stewardship guideline,T4FS:0000447,FAIR principle,"The FAIR principles are guidelines to improve the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse of digital assets. The principles emphasise machine-actionability (i.e., the capacity of computational systems to find, access, interoperate, and reuse data with none or minimal human intervention) because humans increasingly rely on computational support to deal with data as a result of the increase in volume, complexity, and creation speed of data. The principles refer to three types of entities: data (or any digital object), metadata (information about that digital object), and infrastructure."
