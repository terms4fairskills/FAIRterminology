Building a terminology for the skills necessary to make data FAIR and to keep it FAIR.

The terms4FAIRskills project aims to create a formalised terminology that describes the competencies, skills and knowledge associated with making and keeping data FAIR.

When mature, this terminology will apply to a variety of use cases, including:
- To assist with the creation and assessment of stewardship curricula;
- To facilitate the annotation, discovery and evaluation of FAIR-enabling materials (e.g. training) and resources;
- To enable the formalisation of job descriptions and CVs with recognised, structured competencies.

The completed terminology will be of use to trainers who teach FAIR data skills, researchers who wish to identify skill gaps in their teams and managers who need to recruit individuals to relevant roles.

This repository will be used to store the OWL version of the terminology, plus related files. Many of these files will be a 'work in progress'.

In July 2020, we received notification of our successful application for EOSC co-creation funding to continue this work.

Thanks to our successful EOSC co-creation proposal, we continued to develop the Terms4FAIRskills (T4FS) using two real-life use cases - the CODATA/RDA Summer Schools and the ELIXIR Training Platform Training and Events Portal (TeSS). Through a number of workshops and hackathons, we iteratively annotated a large number of training materials using the Semaphora annotation tool.

Our report on this work can be found on Zenodo at the following DOI: [10.5281/zenodo.4705219](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4705219).

We continue to develop terms4FAIRskills and our latest terminology will always be found in our related GitHub repository. New term requests and queries can be posted on our issue tracker..

## Views on the Ontology

We currently produce two primary views of this ontology: a complete ontology intended for expert consumption, and fully adhering to the OBO Foundry principles, and a community view that has been simplified for general usage.

## Versions

### Stable release versions

The latest version of the ontology can always be found at:

http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/t4fs.owl

### Editors' version

Editors of this ontology should use the templates available for comment via our (Google spreadsheet)[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pu9o8oiP1hwnyQk1tv_8cdoe07GngINRD5pGz04m4Zo/edit?usp=sharing]. The default permissions for this spreadsheet is Comment only. Please ask if you would like permission to modify it. The "traditional" editable document for the ODK build procedure is [src/ontology/t4fs-edit.owl](src/ontology/t4fs-edit.owl), however this is automatically built via templates.

By using Google spreadsheets, we open up our ontology for comment and editing to our community who are experts in the domain but who may not be ontologists.

## Contact

Please use this GitHub repository's [Issue tracker](https://github.com/terms4FAIRskills/FAIRterminology/issues) to request new terms/classes or report errors or specific concerns related to the ontology.
