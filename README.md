Building a terminology for the skills necessary to make data FAIR and to keep it FAIR. It is now an official OBO Foundry ontology.

The terms4FAIRskills project aims to create a formalised terminology that describes the competencies, skills and knowledge associated with making and keeping data FAIR.

This terminology applies to a variety of use cases, including:
- To assist with the creation and assessment of stewardship curricula;
- To facilitate the annotation, discovery and evaluation of FAIR-enabling materials (e.g. training) and resources;
- To enable the formalisation of job descriptions and CVs with recognised, structured competencies.

The completed terminology is of use to trainers who teach FAIR data skills, researchers who wish to identify skill gaps in their teams and managers who need to recruit individuals to relevant roles.

This repository is used to store the OWL version of the terminology, plus related files.

In July 2020, we received notification of our successful application for EOSC co-creation funding to continue this work.

Thanks to our successful EOSC co-creation proposal, we continued to develop the Terms4FAIRskills (T4FS) using two real-life use cases - the CODATA/RDA Summer Schools and the ELIXIR Training Platform Training and Events Portal (TeSS). Through a number of workshops and hackathons, we iteratively annotated a large number of training materials using the Semaphora annotation tool.

Our report on this work can be found on Zenodo at the following DOI: [10.5281/zenodo.4705219](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4705219).

We continue to develop terms4FAIRskills and our latest terminology will always be found here. New term requests and queries can be posted on our issue tracker.

## Views on the Ontology

We currently produce two primary views of this ontology: a complete ontology intended for expert consumption, and fully adhering to the OBO Foundry principles, and a community view that has been simplified for general usage.

## Versions

### Stable release versions

The latest version of the ontology can always be found at:

http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/t4fs.owl

### Alternative Artefacts

In addition to the stable release version listed above, we have a variety of different ways in which you can view T4FS. All artefacts other than `community` are as defined https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/blob/master/docs/ReleaseArtefacts.md:

* base
* simple
* full
* community: this is a version of t4fs without the upper-level BFO terms, giving our those in our community not familiar with ULOs a view that they are used to.

### Alternative formats

We produce all ontology artefacts in the following formats:
* OWL
* OBO
* JSON

### Editors' version

T4FS uses templates to edit the ontology. This means that you should not edit any of the OWL files that you see in this repository. Instead, please see our [Contributing README](CONTRIBUTING.md) and our [Templates README](src/templates/README.md) for more details.

## Contact

Please use this GitHub repository's [Issue tracker](https://github.com/terms4FAIRskills/FAIRterminology/issues) to request new terms/classes or report errors or specific concerns related to the ontology.
