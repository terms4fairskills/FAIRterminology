# terms4FAIRskills

Building a terminology for the skills necessary to make data FAIR and to keep it FAIR.

The terms4FAIRskills project aims to create a formalised terminology that describes the competencies, skills and knowledge associated with making and keeping data FAIR. When mature, this terminology will apply to a variety of use cases, including:
- To assist with the creation and assessment of stewardship curricula;
- To facilitate the annotation, discovery and evaluation of FAIR-enabling materials (e.g. training) and resources;
- To enable the formalisation of job descriptions and CVs with recognised, structured competencies.

The completed terminology will be of use to trainers who teach FAIR data skills, researchers who wish to identify skill gaps in their teams and managers who need to recruit individuals to relevant roles.

This repository will be used to store the OWL version of the terminology, plus related files. Many of these files will be a 'work in progress'.

In July 2020, we received notification of our successful application for EOSC co-creation funding to continue this work.

Thanks to our successful EOSC co-creation proposal, we will continue to develop the FAIR Skills Terminology (FST) with our annotation and coordination groups to create v0.1 of the terminology. We will use a number of real-world use cases to drive this development to ensure a broad and pragmatic initial spread of terms. These terms will be refined via iterative annotation of training materials. Annotation will be performed using the Semaphora tool and will continue until an initial prototype terminology is created.

We will use this repository as a space to work on the development of the terminology, from a collaborative google spreadsheet(used to generate and collate the terms and their definitions) to a true hierarchial terminology, including terms from other terminologies such as CASRAI, using Robot and hand-crafted artisanal csv files.
